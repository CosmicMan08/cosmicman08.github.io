        <h1>Welcome to my Baldi studies</h1>
        <p>
            For a while i've kept my thoughts on baldi ""lore"" in the wiki server or sometimes, <b>sometimes,</b> i'd put them in a google doc. <br>
            i don't want to keep using google docs so i'm gonna put some future stuff here<br>
            <br>
            right here there's nothing special though... oh wait!<br>
            here's the back button. <br>
